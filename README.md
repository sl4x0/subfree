# Subfree

Subfree is a tool that allows you to fetch subdomains using free open API resources without the need for an API key. This tool is ideal for those who are just starting with subdomain enumeration and do not have access to expensive tools or resources.

## Installation

Subfree can be installed using Git. Simply run the following command:

```console
git clone https://github.com/sl4x0/subfree.git
cd subfree
chmod +x subfree.sh
```

## Usage

To use Subfree, simply run the following command:

```console
./subfree.sh <domain>
```

Replace <domain> with the domain you want to enumerate subdomains for.

Subfree uses free open API resources to fetch subdomains. This means that there is a limit to the number of subdomains that can be fetched per day. 
If you encounter any issues with the tool, please try open an [issue](https://github.com/sl4x0/subfree/issues).
